# About

This is a mock server that aims to replicate the functionality of the Wind API to make the game work. Included in the Release is a custom build of RPCS3 by Killer0byte that allows the game to properly read .tss files, as well as a built-in patch to unlock all DLC and infinite fuel.

# Cheat Engine

Right now, this server does not implement save-data backup, so you should not be using Cheat Engine with this server, as you risk corrupting save data that is stored on the RPCN server, which will be very annoying to restore.

# Supported Platforms
- Windows

# Requirements
- [ASP.NET Core Runtime 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) (Hosting Bundle recommended for Windows)
- [PS3 Firmware](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/)
- A legitimate copy of Ace Combat: Infinity v2.11 and your .RAP license file.

# Setup
1. In Releases, download `AeroServer-X.X-(OS).zip` and `RPCS3-Title-Small-Storage-support-7e250c5-2.zip`.

2. Extract the .zip files.
NOTE: The game patch and custom configuration have already been applied in the RPCS3 build in advance. It is not recommended to change your custom game configuration's network settings unless necessary.

3. Open the `RPCS3-Title-Small-Storage-support-7e250c5-2` folder and launch `rpcs3.exe`.

4. Install PS3 Firmware: Select `File` -> `Install Firmware` -> select your `PS3UPDAT.PUP` file.

5. Install Game: Select `File` -> `Add Games` -> select your game folder.

6. Install License: Select `File` -> `Install Packages/Raps/Edats` -> select your .RAP file.

7. Click the icon labelled `RPCN` and sign in to RPCN.

8. (Windows) Open the `AeroServer-X.X-(OS)` folder and launch `AeroServer-X.X-(OS).exe`.  
(Linux) Navigate to `AeroServer-X.X-(OS)` and run `sudo ./AeroServer-X.X-(OS)`.

9. Upon launching the server for the first time, if you see alternating yellow and green lines, then that is a good sign. The server is successfully downloading the missing files it needs to feed the game.

10. Launch the game and reclaim the skies.
